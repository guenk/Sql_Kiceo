Database about the line two in Vannes

You got the Mcd picture in Jpg Format.

I suggest you to start Workbench Mysql or something you like.

First you need to launch the script schema.sql to generate the structure.

Secondly launch data.sql to fill the database.

In the end you got requetes.sql available to try and find the best way to use the bus.
